### *“Mathematics is the language in which God has written the universe.”* — Galileo Galilei

This repository serves as the central laboratory for my academic journey at the **University of Buenos Aires (UBA)**. It is a systematic effort to translate the rigorous theoretical foundations of Calculus and Linear Algebra into functional computational models.

## 🎯 Mission & Philosophy

The goal of this project is to achieve a deep, first-principles understanding of Physics and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). Instead of treating code as a black box, I use it to verify and visualize the mathematical structures learned in:

- **Calculus:** Following the rigorous approach of **Michael Spivak**.
- **Linear Algebra:** Mastering vector spaces and linear transformations through **Gilbert Strang**.

## 🏗️ Core Pillars

1. **Rigorous Analysis:** Translating epsilon-delta proofs and derivative theorems into algorithmic logic.
2. **Computational Linear Algebra:** Implementing matrix factorizations and eigensystems to understand data structures.
3. **Physical Simulations:** Visualizing quantum and classical phenomena using the **Scientific Python Stack** (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib).

## 🚀 Featured Experiment (In Progress)

### ⚛️ Electron Probability Distribution (Hydrogen Atom 1s State)
**Objective:** Visualize the radial probability density of an electron in the ground state of a Hydrogen atom.

- **The Math:** $P(r) = r^2 \cdot e^{-2r}$
- **The Physics:** Understanding the Bohr radius and the balance between geometric volume expansion ($r^2$) and electrostatic decay ($e^{-2r}$).
- **Status:** *Pending Implementation (Learning NumPy vectorization).*

## 🛠️ Environment & Tools

- **OS:** Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
- **WM:** bspwm (Customized for deep work and productivity)
- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Documentation:** LaTeX for mathematical notation.
